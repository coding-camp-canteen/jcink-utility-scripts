# Bracca: Theme Utility Scripts

A collection of random little utility scripts useful in Jcink and other forum custom themes.

> Bracca is a junkyard planet known for ship salvage in _Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order_.

For information on what each script does and how to use it, see the README file in its directory within [`dist`](/dist).

Scripts that can be used more broadly can be found directly in [`dist`](/dist). Scripts only meant to work with a specific forum host will be in a sub-directory with a matching name. For example, the `move-recent-topics/index.js` script is specific to Jcink, and can therefore be found at [`dist/jcink/move-recent-topics/`](/dist/jcink/move-recent-topics).

The latest versions of the scripts are available via `https://magrathea.guide/bracca/dist/`. If you'd like to pin to a specific version of a script instead, try [jsDelivr](https://www.jsdelivr.com/).
